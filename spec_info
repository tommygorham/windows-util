POWERSHELL SYSTEMINFO COMMANDS 
  CPU INFO 
    Description: Though you can run winkey+R:msinfo32 for a GUI of system info on windows 10/11 (and probably down to Windows Vista),
                 for things like creating batch scripts, mimicking 'lscpu' in windows, or analyzing code performance and writing to .csv
                 You can use the following commmands in Powershell for formatted cpu specs
    
    Command:     wmic cpu list /format:list
    Command:     wmic CPU Get architecture,DeviceID,Name,NumberOfCores,NumberOfLogicalProcessors,ThreadCount,SocketDesignation,
                 ProcessorType,L2CacheSize,L3CacheSize,Family,Caption,Version,Manufacturer,MaxClockSpeed /format:list
                 
  RAM INFO
    Description: banklabel: which slots the RAM chips are installed in  
                 capacity: size in bytes
                 devicelocator: another entity to tell which slots the RAM chips are installed in.
                 speed: speed of ram
                 memorytype: 24 means DDR3 RAM, 0 most likely means DDR4 RAM, as DDR4 is unknown to WMIC command
                 typedetail: 
                 formfactor: 8 means DIMM, 12 means SODIMM
    Command:     wmic MEMORYCHIP get banklabel,capacity,devicelocator,speed,memorytype,typedetail,formfactor
    Command:     systeminfo | findstr /C:"Total Physical Memory"
    
   GPU/IGPU INFO
    Command:     wmic path win32_videocontroller get name,videoarchitecture,videomemorytype,currentrefreshrate,maxrefreshrate,minrefreshrate,
                 currentnumberofrows,currentnumberofcolumns,status,maxmemorysupported,currentbitsperpixel,currentverticalresolution,deviceid,
                 description,availability,adaptercompatibility,adapterram,videoprocessor,adapterdactype,acceleratorcapabilities /format:list

  OS INFO
    Command: wmic os get version,caption,description,numberofprocesses
